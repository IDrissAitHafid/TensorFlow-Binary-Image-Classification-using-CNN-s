# TensorFlow-Image-Classification-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

This is a repository containing datasets of 6400 training images and 1243 testing images. 

Classes are table/glass.

Classes are equal(3200 glass -3200 table). 

There is no high-level API like Keras or TFLearn. Just TensorFlow.

There is no problematic image in training and testing dataset.

Download dataset from the link below. It is 101 MB:
